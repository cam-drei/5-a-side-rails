      <p>There’s nowhere quite as lonely on the football field as when you realise you’re defending 2 vs 1. When you’re the only defender standing in the way of a stampede of attackers, that can be a bit disconcerting.</p>
      <p>Let’s be honest, in 2 v 1&nbsp;situations the odds are not on your side. But that’s no reason to admit defeat.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are still ways to play this situation which will minimise the opponent’s chances of scoring and maximise your own chances of being a hero.</p>
      <p>2 v 1 situations generally arise on the break, &nbsp;when your team&nbsp;has&nbsp;committed players forward and the ball has been lost, leaving a solitary player at the back to hold the fort. Your job is to delay and, if possible, break-up the&nbsp;onslaught of attacking play to save your team from conceding a goal.</p>
      <p>So here’s some simple steps to playing&nbsp;the situation:</p>
      <h1>1) Initial positioning as last defender – hold the centre</h1>
      <p>If you are the covering player, the last defender, then you can ensure you position yourself correctly before the 2 v 1 even arises. This means positioning yourself centrally – which you might hear referred to as ‘closing up the centre’.</p>
      <p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.5-a-side.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Closing-up-the-centre-2v1-defending.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4434" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.5-a-side.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Closing-up-the-centre-2v1-defending.png?resize=700%2C541" alt="Closing up the centre - 2v1 defending" width="697" height="539" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.5-a-side.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Closing-up-the-centre-2v1-defending.png?w=700 700w, https://i2.wp.com/www.5-a-side.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Closing-up-the-centre-2v1-defending.png?resize=300%2C232 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"></a></p>
      <p>In the diagram above, the moment that player A steps forward with the ball, player B is out of the action. Moving towards the middle, is a much better move, in case the attack breaks down and he faces the counter attack.</p>
      <p>Being in this position will often allow you to sweep up the ball before the opponents even get a chance to latch on to it. But even if the ball breaks to the opponent,&nbsp;your presence in the centre&nbsp;will ensure that they don’t have a clear and easy route to goal.</p>
      <p>So if&nbsp;you&nbsp;find yourself not positioned centrally when the break&nbsp;is on, then unless it’s obvious that you should press your nearest player immediately, it’s important that you recover the centre ground as quickly as possible. The quicker you can get back in, the harder it’s going to be for the opponent.</p>
      <h1>2) &nbsp;Be on your toes, body shape open, and ready to react</h1>
      <p>There are an infinite number of possibilities when it comes to how the two attacking player can combine together to try and outfox you. No two situations will be exactly the same.&nbsp;The trick to defending is to be able to adapt&nbsp;as the play&nbsp;unfolds.</p>
      <p>To best&nbsp;do this,&nbsp;you need to be on your toes and ready to pounce&nbsp;on any opportunity that arises. Being on your heels, or ‘flat footed’, isn’t going to help you react quickly.</p>
      <p>In addition, you should keep your body shape open so that you can see both players at the same time.</p>
      <p>It’s important that you don’t turn fully towards one of the players otherwise you won’t be able to see the other attacker – and turning will take you that much longer. Prescious split-seconds that can be the difference between success and failure.</p>
      <p>If you want to see someone poised and positioned&nbsp;in the 2 vs 1 situation, modelling yourself on Vincent Kompany is a good place to begin:</p>
      <p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7w-B8anTm8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;"></iframe></span></p>
      <p>Sure, he does look to be destroying two members of the youth academy, but there’s a lot to learn from his technique and aggression.</p>
      <h1>3) &nbsp;Delay by blocking the passing lanes but don’t over commit</h1>
      <p>The ‘passing lane’ is the term we use to describe a line between the two attackers which the ball will need to travel along for a pass.</p>
      <p>To defend effectively you should position yourself so that you put pressure on that passing lane, causing the attacker with the ball to think twice about whether they should make the pass&nbsp;or whether to run with the ball instead. This decision might only cost them a second or two, but that’s valuable time allowing your teammates to recover.</p><div class="google-auto-placed ap_container" style="width: 100%; height: auto; clear: none; text-align: center;"><ins data-ad-format="auto" class="adsbygoogle adsbygoogle-noablate" data-ad-client="ca-pub-9945134967800799" data-adsbygoogle-status="done" style="display: block; margin: auto; background-color: transparent;"><ins id="aswift_4_expand" style="display:inline-table;border:none;height:175px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:697px;background-color:transparent;"><ins id="aswift_4_anchor" style="display:block;border:none;height:175px;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;visibility:visible;width:697px;background-color:transparent;"><iframe width="697" height="175" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" vspace="0" hspace="0" allowtransparency="true" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="true" onload="var i=this.id,s=window.google_iframe_oncopy,H=s&amp;&amp;s.handlers,h=H&amp;&amp;H[i],w=this.contentWindow,d;try{d=w.document}catch(e){}if(h&amp;&amp;d&amp;&amp;(!d.body||!d.body.firstChild)){if(h.call){setTimeout(h,0)}else if(h.match){try{h=s.upd(h,i)}catch(e){}w.location.replace(h)}}" id="aswift_4" name="aswift_4" style="left:0;position:absolute;top:0;border:0px;width:697px;height:175px;"></iframe></ins></ins></ins></div>
